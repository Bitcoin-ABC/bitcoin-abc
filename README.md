What is Bitcoin?
----------------

Bitcoin is a digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network.

What is Bitcoin XBT?
--------------------

Bitcoin XBT is a "Adjustable Blocksize Cap" implementation of Bitcoin, forked from Bitcoin-ABC and compatible with the 'soon to be' Bitcoin Cash UAHF blockchain. All credit for previous engineering works goes to Satoshi Nakanoto, The Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin-ABC development teams.

Bitcoin XBT is the name of this open source software which enables the use of Bitcoin via the ‘Bitcoin Cash’ network.

It is designed to assist with a hard fork to increase Bitcoin's block size limit.

Bitcoin XBT uses $XBT units of account (other compatible clients may use other abbreviations and naming conventions).
