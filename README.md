What is Bitcoin?
----------------

Bitcoin is a digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network.

What is Bitcoin XBC?
--------------------

Bitcoin XBC is a "Adjustable Block Size" implementation of the original Bitcoin client, allowing up to 8mb block size. Forked from Bitcoin-ABC and compatible with the Bitcoin Cash UAHF blockchain only. All credit for previous engineering work goes to Satoshi Nakamoto, The Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin-ABC development teams.

Bitcoin XBC is the name of this open source software which enables the use of Bitcoin via the ‘Bitcoin Cash’ blockchain.

Bitcoin XBC uses XBC units of account (other compatible clients may use other abbreviations and naming conventions such as BCC or BCH).

Bitcoin XBC is incompatible with Bitcoin Core, if you have previously installed Bitcoin Core please backup or rename your 'Bitcoin' data directory before installing Bitcoin XBC.
