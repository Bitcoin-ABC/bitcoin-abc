What is Wormhole
-----------------
Wormhole is a fast, portable Omni Layer implementation that is based off the Bitcoin ABC codebase (currently 0.17.2). This implementation requires no external dependencies extraneous to Bitcoin ABC, and is native to the Bitcoin Cash network just like other Bitcoin Cash nodes. It currently supports a wallet mode and is seamlessly available on three platforms: Windows, Linux and Mac OS. Wormhole Cash Layer extensions are expohttps://travis-ci.org/copernet/wormhole.svg?branch=mastersed via the JSON-RPC interface. Development has been consolidated on the Wormhole product, and it is the reference client for the Wormhole Cash Layer.


What is Bitcoin Cash
--------------------
Bitcoin Cash is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin Cash is a descendant of Bitcoin. It became a separate currency from the version supported by Bitcoin Core when the two split on August 1, 2017. Bitcoin Cash and the Bitcoin Core version of Bitcoin share the same transaction history up until the split.

What is the Omni Layer
----------------------
The Omni Layer is a communications protocol that uses the Bitcoin block chain to enable features such as smart contracts, user currencies and decentralized peer-to-peer exchanges. A common analogy that is used to describe the relation of the Omni Layer to Bitcoin is that of HTTP to TCP/IP: HTTP, like the Omni Layer, is the application layer to the more fundamental transport and internet layer of TCP/IP, like Bitcoin.
