What is BCash?
---------------------

[BCash](https://www.bitcoincash.org/) is an experimental digital currency
that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It uses peer-to-peer
technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing
money are carried out collectively by the network. BCash is a descendant of
Bitcoin. It became a separate currency from the version supported by Bitcoin Core
when the two split on August 1, 2017. BCash and Bitcoin share the same transaction history up until the split.

--------------------

Bitcoin ABC is the name of open-source software which enables the use of BCash.
It is a fork of the [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org) software project.
