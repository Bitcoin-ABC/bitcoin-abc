===========

The goal of DeVault is to create sound money that is usable by everyone in
the world. We believe this is a civilization-changing technology which will
dramatically increase human flourishing, freedom, and prosperity. The project
aims to achieve this goal by implementing a series of optimizations and
protocol upgrades that will enable peer-to-peer digital cash to scale many
orders of magnitude beyond current limits.
