                            Avalanche is a revolutionary consensus algorithm
                            integrated with eCash&apos;s core Proof-of-Work,
                            enabling instant transactions, enhanced security,
                            subnets, staking rewards for node operators and
                            fork-free upgrades. This hybrid consensus model
                            pushes eCash to the forefront of blockchain
                            technology.

                            eCash is a technical solution to a political
                            problem: what&rsquo;s the best money? Monetary
                            ecosystems have many important stakeholders. Proof
                            of work mining has extensive empirical history and
                            ensures that some stakeholders are incentivized to
                            continue supporting the network.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Recent crypto developments have also proven the
                            value of holder-based staking. Because the focus of
                            eCash is on building the best money possible, rather
                            than building a Twitter religion, every technically
                            feasible solution is on the table. Avalanche staking
                            will be a critical part of eCash governance and user
                            incentivization.

                            Subnets are customized networks linked to the main
                            eCash network. They will allow developers to build
                            networks with unique or experimental properties
                            &mdash; while tethering value to the main eCash
                            network.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The technology is powered by subsets of Avalanche
                            validators, who monitor the subnets to validate
                            token tranfers to and from the subnet. This enables
                            decentralized and trustless setup.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Subnets enable eCash to natively connect with the
                            wider DeFi ecosystem. Services can run their subnets
                            with customized rules and properties according to
                            their business requirements, including privately
                            owned ones. Two subnets planned by the eCash team
                            are an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and a
                            Zero-Knowledge (ZK) privacy subnet.

                            Chronik is an indexer integrated right into the

                            interacting with the blockchain. This super fast,
                            reliable and highly scalable indexing solution makes
                            it easy for developers to bootstrap and leverage
                            native support for all available features on the
                            eCash network.

                            eCash supports tokens that anyone can create and
                            trade with a few clicks. Instantly create your NFT
                            collection or fungible tokens with your own name,
                            supply, decimal places and icon -- all for the low
                            cost and high speed of a single eCash transaction
                            (much less than $0.01).

                            enjoy higher bull market appreciation. Because the
                            eCash team is incentivized to ensure the highest
                            currency valuation possible, this change was a

                            You can&rsquo;t always say what you think anymore.
                            More and more, Big Tech controls what you can see
                            and say. On the internet, privacy is the only way to
                            defend your individual freedom.

                        <p>
                            eCash is built by early Bitcoin developers who have
                            been working to solve the problem of internet and
                            financial privacy long before Satoshi&rsquo;s
                            whitepaper. Unfortunately, data analytics and
                            tracking technology have advanced while Bitcoin
                            privacy tech has remained stagnant.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Privacy is fundamental to sound money. This is why
                            eCash supports the CashFusion protocol. CashFusion
                            offers anonymity comparable to the top privacy coins
                            while maintaining an auditable supply cap. It can be
                            turned on or off at any time within Electrum ABC.
