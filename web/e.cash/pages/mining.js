                    eCash blocks are produced through a process called mining.
                    Mining involves performing resource-intensive computations
                    to produce Proof-of-Work, which powers eCashâ€™s Nakamoto
                    consensus system, similar to Bitcoin.

                <p>
                    Mining is a specialized industry that uses purpose-built
                    machines called mining rigs. These machines contain custom
                    ASIC chips, and must be purchased specifically for crypto
                    mining. Mining operations vary in scale from large
                    industrial operations with full data-center warehouses with
                    thousands of mining rigs, to hobbyists who run a small
                    number of mining rigs at home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Different cryptocurrencies may use different mining
                    algorithms requiring different hardware. In the case of
                    eCash, it uses the same SHA256 mining algorithm as Bitcoin,
                    and thus BTC miners can also be used to mine eCash.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you have a mining rig set up, you have two options to
                    start mining. You can point your hash power to a mining
                    service provider, or you can set up infrastructure to mine
                    on your own.
                </p>
                <H3 text="Using a mining service provider" />
                <p>
                    Using a service provider has the advantage that it will
                    handle technical setup for you, typically in exchange for a
                    fee.
                </p>
                <h4>Solo mining with a service provider</h4>
                <p>
                    One option is to &ldquo;solo mine&rdquo;, while outsourcing
                    the block template contruction. This means the miner can
                    point their hash power at a stratum endpoint, and they will
                    receive the full miner portion of the block reward when
                    their miners find a block.

                <p>
                    Many mining services offer mining &ldquo;pools&rdquo;, which
                    smooth out mining rewards to make payouts steadier and more
                    predictable. There are several pools for mining eCash. Some
                    options are listed here:

                <p>
                    Rather than relying on a service provider, a miner can take
                    on the responsibility of handling their own technical setup.
                    The advantage is that you retain privacy, and full control
                    of the operation by not relying on a third party.

                <h4>Solo mining</h4>
                <p>
                    Solo mining requires running an eCash node along with
                    specialized mining software. Such mining software is
                    available{' '}

                <h4>Operating a mining pool</h4>
                <p>
                    Adding eCash to a mining pool can be an attractive option.
                    Because eCash uses the same SHA256 mining algorithm as
                    Bitcoin, the technical requirements are similar. One aspect
                    to keep in mind, however, is that miners need to be aware of
                    the avalanche consensus layer on eCash, to ensure that the
                    blocks they produce will be accepted by the avalanche
                    validators.
                </p>
                <h4>General recommendations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The node generating the block template should have
                        avalanche enabled (it is enabled by default).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In order to maximize profit, a mining node can also be
                        <Link href="/staking/"> staking </Link>
                        and benefit from the staking rewards.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure the node has good connectivity. It should accept
                        inbound connections, accept both IPv4 and IPv6, and have
                        no restriction in the number of connections (e.g. no{' '}
                        <code>maxconnection</code> config set).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All the rules listed below are mandatory. If any is
                        skipped your block will be rejected by the Avalanche
                        consensus layer even though your node may succeed in
                        submitting the block.
                    </li>

                        If you need any help to add eCash support to your mining

                    . This feature increases the difficulty when blocks are
                    found at a faster rate than the expected 10 minutes average
                    interval. The difficulty monotonically decreases over time
                    until it reaches a plateau value. This is intended to avoid
                    spikes in the difficulty that can lead to inconsistent block
                    intervals.

                    Your pool software need to make sure the submitted block
                    hash complies with the Real Time Target. There are 2 options
                    to achieve this:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Read the real time target from the block template.
                            The value is directly available in compact form in
                            the field &ldquo;rtt.nexttarget&rdquo;. This field
                            is updated at each call to
                            &ldquo;getblocktemplate&rdquo;.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Locally compute the target on the pool software. The
                            formula is below:
                            <CodeBlock code={rttFormulae} />
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <strong>Notes:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Real Time Target does not impact the block
                            header, in particular the difficulty bits should be
                            the ones from the block template &ldquo;bits&rdquo;
                            field.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If your local time differs from the
                            &ldquo;rtt.nodetime&rdquo; field, you can use this
                            value to compensate or fix you system time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The node needs to accumulate 17 blocks before it is
                            able to compute the Real Time Target (the
                            &ldquo;rtt.prevheadertime&rdquo; array will contain
                            0 values otherwise). This could cause the node to
                            mine at a lower difficulty during that time and get
                            rejected blocks. In order to avoid this issue, you
                            can add the option
                            &ldquo;persistrecentheaderstime=1&rdquo; to your
                            node configuration file. This instructs the node to
                            save the reference times to disk and reload them on
                            startup. This could cause a slight overshoot of the
                            difficulty if a block is found while the node is
                            restarting, but will ensure that no block will be
                            rejected.
