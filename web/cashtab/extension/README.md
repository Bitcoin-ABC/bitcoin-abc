# CashTab extension

Some minor but important code changes are required to build CashTab as a browser extension.

1. Add option to open extension in tab
2. Unique format of manifest.json with sha256 hash of any external scripts
3. CSS rules for extension pop-up sizing

Source files unique to the browser extension are kept in the `extension/` directory.
