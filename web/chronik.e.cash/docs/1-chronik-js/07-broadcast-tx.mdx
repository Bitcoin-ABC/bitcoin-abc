# Broadcast Transactions
Broadcast transactions onto the blockchain

## `broadcastTx(rawTx, skipTokenChecks?)`

Broadcast the given raw tx onto the network; by default will verify that no tokens are unintentionally burned.
Can be disabled with `skipTokenChecks` set to `true`, but this is not recommended.

See [broadcastTx](api/classes/ChronikClientNode#broadcasttx) API docs.

```jsx live
function DemoBroadcastTx() {
  return <Json fn={async () => {
    // Tx tries to burn the first CRD mint baton
    return await chronik.broadcastTx(
      "000000000145e1f25de444e399b6d46fa66e3424c04549a85a14b12bc9a4ddc9" +
      "cdcdcdcdcd0100000000000000000000000000");
  }} />;
}
```

## `broadcastTxs(rawTxs, skipTokenChecks?)`

Broadcast the given raw txs onto the network, by defailt only if all of them pass the token checks
that verify that no tokens are unintentionally burned.
Can be disabled with `skipTokenChecks` set to `true`, but this is not recommended.

See [broadcastTxs](api/classes/ChronikClientNode#broadcasttxs) API docs.

```jsx live
function DemoBroadcastTxs() {
  return <Json fn={async () => {
    // Txs try to burn the first CRD mint baton
    return await chronik.broadcastTxs(
      ["000000000145e1f25de444e399b6d46fa66e3424c04549a85a14b12bc9a4ddc9" +
       "cdcdcdcdcd0100000000000000000000000000",
       "010000000145e1f25de444e399b6d46fa66e3424c04549a85a14b12bc9a4ddc9" +
