# Privacy Policy for Marlin Wallet

**Last Updated:** November 25, 2025

## Introduction

Marlin Wallet ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application ("App").

## Information We Collect

### 1. Camera Data

- **Purpose:** The App requests camera permission to scan QR codes for payment addresses and transaction requests.
- **Usage:** Camera access is only activated when you initiate QR code scanning. We do not:
    - Store any images or video from your camera
    - Record video or take photos
    - Transmit camera data to any external servers
    - Access your camera when the scanning feature is not in use
- **Data Retention:** No camera data is stored or retained.

### 2. NFC (Near Field Communication) Data

- **Purpose:** The App uses NFC to:
    - Receive payment requests from NFC-enabled devices or cards
    - Emulate payment cards for contactless transactions (Host Card Emulation)
- **Usage:** NFC is only active when you initiate a payment transaction or when the App is in the foreground and receives an NFC payment request.
- **Data Collected:** We process payment URIs received via NFC to facilitate transactions. This data is processed locally and not transmitted to external servers.
- **Data Retention:** Payment request data is processed in real-time and not stored.

### 3. Biometric Data

- **Purpose:** The App uses biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition, or other device-supported biometrics) to secure access to your wallet's private keys.
- **Usage:** Biometric authentication is used to:
    - Encrypt and store your wallet's mnemonic phrase in the device's secure keychain
    - Authenticate access to your stored wallet data
- **Important:** Your biometric data never leaves your device. Biometric authentication is handled entirely by your device's operating system. We do not:
    - Collect, store, or transmit your biometric data
    - Have access to your actual biometric information
    - Use biometric data for any purpose other than local authentication

### 4. Wallet Data

- **Purpose:** The App stores your wallet information locally on your device to enable cryptocurrency transactions.
- **Data Stored Locally:**
    - Wallet mnemonic phrases (encrypted in device keychain)
    - Wallet addresses (only for the watch apps)
- **Data Retrieved from Blockchain:**
    - Transaction history is retrieved from the blockchain network when needed
    - Wallet balances are calculated by querying the blockchain for unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs)
    - Wallet addresses are derived from your stored mnemonic phrase
- **Security:** All sensitive wallet data (mnemonic phrases and private keys) is encrypted using your device's secure keychain and protected by biometric authentication or device PIN/password.
- **Data Transmission:** Your private keys and mnemonic phrases are never transmitted to any external servers. Only public blockchain queries (to retrieve transaction history and check balances) are made to blockchain networks.

### 5. Internet Connectivity

- **Purpose:** The App requires internet connectivity to:
    - Query blockchain networks for transaction information
    - Synchronize wallet balances
    - Broadcast transactions to the blockchain
- **Data Transmitted:** Only public blockchain queries are made. No personal information or private keys are transmitted.

### 6. Device Information

- **Purpose:** The App may collect basic device information necessary for app functionality.
- **Data Collected:** Device model, operating system version, and app version (for compatibility and support purposes).
- **Usage:** This information is used solely for app functionality and is not used for tracking or advertising purposes.

## How We Use Your Information

- Provide wallet functionality and enable cryptocurrency transactions
- Secure access to your wallet through biometric authentication

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage:** All sensitive data (wallet mnemonics, private keys) is stored locally on your device in encrypted form using the device's secure keychain.
- **No Cloud Storage:** We do not store your wallet data on any external servers or cloud services.
- **Encryption:** All sensitive data is encrypted using industry-standard encryption methods and protected by your device's security features.
- **Self-Custodial:** You maintain full control and custody of your private keys and wallet data.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not:

- Sell, rent, or trade your personal information
- Share your wallet data with third parties
- Use your data for advertising or marketing purposes
- Transmit your private keys or mnemonic phrases to any external servers

**Exception:** Public blockchain transactions are inherently public and visible on the blockchain network, as required for blockchain functionality.

## Third-Party Services

The App may connect to:

- **Blockchain Networks:** Public blockchain networks (e.g., eCash network) to query transaction data and broadcast transactions. These are public networks and transactions are visible on the blockchain.
