# token-server

Server to manage Cashtab rewards tokens. May be modified to support other token back-end tasks.

## Development

`npm start` to run locally

Note: you will have to adjust the `imageDir` param in `config` to test serving of static image files

## Note on secrets.ts

You will need a secrets.ts file if you plan to run the server locally (or deployed). If you run `npm test` without a `secrets.ts` file, token-server will use `secrets.sample.ts`.

Some secrets are needed for integration testing. These are included in `secrets.sample.ts`. However, if you have your own `secrets.ts` file, then the tests will reference it (and fail if its `prod` key differs from `secrets.sample.ts`).

## Production

Before running `token-server` in production, you must first set up the file system on your desired server (see "Setting up the file system", below).

Fill out `secrets.ts` with your Telegram bot information.

`token-server` is deployed with docker.

You can test production deployment with

1. Add `EXPOSE 3333` just before `CMD [ "node", "dist/index.js" ]` in `Dockerfile`

2. Build docker container:

```
docker build -t token-server_local .
```

3. Deploy docker container:

Note: replace `/path/to/token-icons` below with your local absolute path

```
docker run -p 3333:3333 --init --rm --name token-server --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/token-icons,target=/token-icons token-server_local
```

4. Test from web browser, e.g. navigate to `localhost:3333/status`

## Setting up the file system

The server file system must be configured for image serving.

1. Create directory for `config.imageDir`
2. Create subdirectories at `config.imageDir` for all supported `config.iconSizes`

For example,

```
mkdir token-icons
mkdir token-icons/32
mkdir token-icons/64
mkdir token-icons/128
```

3. Repeat the above steps for `config.rejectedDir`

e.g.

```
mkdir rejected
mkdir rejected/32
mkdir rejected/64
mkdir rejected/128
```
