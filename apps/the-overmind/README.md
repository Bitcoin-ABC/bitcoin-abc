# The Overmind

A telegram bot for rewarding and punishing users with onchain token transactions in the main eCash telegram channel

Roadmap

[] Add support for "register" function, i.e. assigning an address to a user
[] Add support for airdropping a token to users that register
[] Add support for likes, a way for any registered user to send tokens to any registered user by emoji reacting to their msg or replying with an emoji
[] Add support for dislike, a way for any registered user to TAKE tokens from any registered user. This must have spam protection, i.e. a "downvote" must cost the downvoting user something as well. Downvote decrements should go to a bot treasury
[] Add admin features to airdrop from the bot treasury or super react
[] Add arbitrary tipping
[] Mute users below certain token balances
[] Require users to register before they can talk in the telegram
