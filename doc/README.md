Bitcoin ABC
=====================

Setup
---------------------
Bitcoin ABC is a fork of Bitcoin Core, which is the original Bitcoin client and builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and stores the entire history of Bitcoin transactions (which is currently several GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Bitcoin ABC, visit [bitcoinabc.org](https://download.bitcoinabc.org/).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Bitcoin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/bitcoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/bitcoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run bitcoin-qt.exe.

### OS X
