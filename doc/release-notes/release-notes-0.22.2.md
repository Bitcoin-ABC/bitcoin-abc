  <https://download.bitcoinabc.org/0.22.2/>

This release includes the following features and fixes:
- New `minerfund` subfield of `coinbasetxn` in `getblocktemplate` to enable
  easy fetching of valid addresses for infrastructure funding.
- Various UX improvements related to watch-only wallets and to the send coins dialog in bitcoin-qt.
- Various stability and logging improvements to the wallet database and associated tools.

RPC changes
-----------
- The `gettransaction` RPC now accepts a third (boolean) argument `verbose`. If
  set to `true`, a new `decoded` field will be added to the response containing
  the decoded transaction. This field is equivalent to RPC `decoderawtransaction`,
  or RPC `getrawtransaction` when `verbose` is passed.
- `pruneblockheight` has been fixed to return the correct `pruneheight`.
- Fixes to help texts for various RPCs.
