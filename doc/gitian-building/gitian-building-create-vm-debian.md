Create a new VirtualBox VM
--------------------------
In the VirtualBox GUI click "New" and choose the following parameters in the wizard:

![](figs/create_new_vm_debian.png)

- Type: Linux, Debian (64-bit)

![](figs/create_vm_memsize.png)

- Memory Size: at least 3000MB, anything less and the build might not complete.

![](figs/create_vm_hard_disk.png)

- Hard Disk: Create a virtual hard disk now

![](figs/create_vm_hard_disk_file_type.png)

- Hard Disk file type: Use the default, VDI (VirtualBox Disk Image)

![](figs/create_vm_storage_physical_hard_disk.png)

- Storage on physical hard disk: Dynamically Allocated

![](figs/create_vm_file_location_size.png)

- File location and size: at least 40GB
- Click `Create`

After creating the VM, we need to configure it.

- Click the `Settings` button, then go to `System` tab and `Processor` sub-tab. Increase the number of processors to the number of cores on your machine if you want builds to be faster.

![](figs/system_settings.png)

- Go to the `Network` tab. Adapter 1 should be attached to `NAT`.

![](figs/network_settings.png)

- Click `Advanced`, then `Port Forwarding`. We want to set up a port through which we can reach the VM to get files in and out.
- Create a new rule by clicking the plus icon.

![](figs/port_forwarding_rules.png)

- Set up the new rule the following way:
  - Name: `SSH`
  - Protocol: `TCP`
  - Leave Host IP empty
  - Host Port: `22222`
  - Leave Guest IP empty
  - Guest Port: `22`

- Click `Ok` twice to save.

Get the [Debian 9.x net installer](https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/9.6.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-9.6.0-amd64-netinst.iso) (a more recent minor version should also work, see also [Debian Network installation](https://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/)).
This DVD image can be [validated](https://www.debian.org/CD/verify) using a SHA256 hashing tool, for example on
Unixy OSes by entering the following in a terminal:

```bash
echo "c51d84019c3637ae9d12aa6658ea8c613860c776bd84c6a71eaaf765a0dd60fe debian-9.6.0-amd64-netinst.iso" | sha256sum -c
    # (must return OK)
```

Replace `sha256sum` with `shasum` on OSX.

Then start the VM. On the first launch you will be asked for a CD or DVD image. Choose the downloaded ISO.

Installing Debian
-----------------

This section will explain how to install Debian on the newly created VM.

- Choose the non-graphical installer.  We do not need the graphical environment; it will only increase installation time and disk usage.

![](figs/debian_install_1_boot_menu.png)

**Note**: Navigating in the Debian installer:
To keep a setting at the default and proceed, just press `Enter`.
To select a different button, press `Tab`.

- Choose locale and keyboard settings (doesn't matter, you can just go with the defaults or select your own information)

![](figs/debian_install_2_select_a_language.png)
![](figs/debian_install_3_select_location.png)
![](figs/debian_install_4_configure_keyboard.png)

- The VM will detect network settings using DHCP, this should all proceed automatically
- Configure the network:
  - Hostname `debian`.
  - Leave domain name empty.

![](figs/debian_install_5_configure_the_network.png)
![](figs/debian_install_6_domain_name.png)

- You can leave the root password empty. Otherwise, enter it twice and remember it for later.

![](figs/debian_install_6a_set_up_root_password.png)

- Name the new user `gitianuser` (the full name doesn't matter, you can leave it empty)
- Set the account username as `gitianuser`

![](figs/debian_install_7_set_up_user_fullname.png)
![](figs/debian_install_8_set_up_username.png)

- Choose a user password and enter it twice (remember it for later)

![](figs/debian_install_9_user_password.png)

- The installer will set up the clock using a time server; this process should be automatic
- Set up the clock: choose a time zone (depends on the locale settings that you picked earlier; specifics don't matter)

![](figs/debian_install_10_configure_clock.png)

- Disk setup
  - Partitioning method: Guided - Use the entire disk

![](figs/debian_install_11_partition_disks.png)

  - Select disk to partition: SCSI1 (0,0,0)

![](figs/debian_install_12_choose_disk.png)

  - Partition Disks -> *All files in one partition*

![](figs/all_files_in_one_partition.png)

  - Finish partitioning and write changes to disk -> *Yes* (`Tab`, `Enter` to select the `Yes` button)

![](figs/debian_install_14_finish.png)
![](figs/debian_install_15_write_changes.png)

- The base system will be installed, this will take a minute or so
- Choose a mirror (any will do)

![](figs/debian_install_16_choose_a_mirror.png)

- Enter proxy information (unless you are on an intranet, leave this empty)

![](figs/debian_install_18_proxy_settings.png)

- Wait a bit while 'Select and install software' runs
- Participate in popularity contest -> *No*
- Choose software to install. We need just the base system.
- Make sure only 'SSH server' and 'Standard System Utilities' are checked
- Uncheck 'Debian Desktop Environment' and 'Print Server'

![](figs/debian_install_19_software_selection.png)

- Install the GRUB boot loader to the master boot record? -> Yes

![](figs/debian_install_20_install_grub.png)

- Device for boot loader installation -> ata-VBOX_HARDDISK

![](figs/debian_install_21_install_grub_bootloader.png)

- Installation Complete -> *Continue*
- After installation, the VM will reboot and you will have a working Debian VM. Congratulations!

![](figs/debian_install_22_finish_installation.png)

Connecting to the VM
--------------------

After the VM has booted you can connect to it using SSH, and files can be copied from and to the VM using a SFTP utility.
Connect to `localhost`, port `22222` (or the port configured when installing the VM).
On Windows you can use [putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) and [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php).

For example, to connect as `gitianuser` from a Linux command prompt use

    $ ssh gitianuser@localhost -p 22222
    The authenticity of host '[localhost]:22222 ([127.0.0.1]:22222)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is ae:f5:c8:9f:17:c6:c7:1b:c2:1b:12:31:1d:bb:d0:c7.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    Warning: Permanently added '[localhost]:22222' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
    gitianuser@localhost's password: (enter gitianuser password configured during install)

    The programs included with the Debian GNU/Linux system are free software;
    the exact distribution terms for each program are described in the
    individual files in /usr/share/doc/*/copyright.

    Debian GNU/Linux comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, to the extent
    permitted by applicable law.
    gitianuser@debian:~$

Use `sudo` to execute commands as root.

Optional - Easier login to the VM
---------------------------------

You'll need to generate an SSH key, e.g. by following the instructions under "Generating a new SSH key" [here](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

After that, login to the VM and enter:

```bash
mkdir .ssh
```

On your machine edit or create `~/.ssh/config` and add:

```bash
Host gitian
    HostName localhost
    Port 22222
    User gitianuser
```

Open a new terminal tab and enter:

```bash
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub gitian:.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Next time you need to login to the VM, just use: `ssh gitian`
