Benchmarking
============

Bitcoin XBT has an internal benchmarking framework, with benchmarks
for cryptographic algorithms such as SHA1, SHA256, SHA512 and RIPEMD160. As well as the rolling bloom filter.

After compiling bitcoin-xbt, the benchmarks can be run with:
`src/bench/bench_bitcoin`

The output will look similar to:
```

More benchmarks are needed for, in no particular order:
- Script Validation
- CCoinDBView caching
- Coins database
- Memory pool
- Wallet coin selection
