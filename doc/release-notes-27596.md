Pruning
-------

When using assumeutxo with `-prune`, the prune budget may be exceeded if it is set
lower than 1100MB (i.e. `MIN_DISK_SPACE_FOR_BLOCK_FILES * 2`). Prune budget is normally
split evenly across each chainstate, unless the resulting prune budget per chainstate
is beneath `MIN_DISK_SPACE_FOR_BLOCK_FILES` in which case that value will be used.

`loadtxoutset` has been added, which allows loading a UTXO snapshot of the format
generated by `dumptxoutset`. Once this snapshot is loaded, its contents will be
deserialized into a second chainstate data structure, which is then used to sync to
the network's tip under a security model very much like `assumevalid`.

Meanwhile, the original chainstate will complete the initial block download process in
the background, eventually validating up to the block that the snapshot is based upon.

The result is a usable bitcoind instance that is current with the network tip in a
matter of minutes rather than hours. UTXO snapshot are typically obtained via
third-party sources (HTTP, torrent, etc.) which is reasonable since their contents
are always checked by hash.

You can find more information on this process in the `assumeutxo` design
document (<https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/design/assumeutxo.md>).
