/**
 * This file offers implementations of the fast range reduction technique

 * https://lemire.me/blog/2016/06/27/a-fast-alternative-to-the-modulo-reduction/
 *
 * In short, they take an integer x and a range n, and return the upper bits of
 * (x * n). If x is uniformly distributed over its domain, the result is as
 * close to uniformly distributed over [0, n) as (x mod n) would be, but
 * significantly faster.
