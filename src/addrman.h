/** Stochastic address manager
 *
 * Design goals:
 *  * Keep the address tables in-memory, and asynchronously dump the entire
 * table to peers.dat.
 *  * Make sure no (localized) attacker can fill the entire table with his
 * nodes/addresses.
 *
 * To that end:
 *  * Addresses are organized into buckets.
 *    * Addresses that have not yet been tried go into 1024 "new" buckets.
 *      * Based on the address range (/16 for IPv4) of the source of
 * information, 64 buckets are selected at random.
 *      * The actual bucket is chosen from one of these, based on the range in
 * which the address itself is located.
 *      * One single address can occur in up to 8 different buckets to increase
 * selection chances for addresses that
 *        are seen frequently. The chance for increasing this multiplicity
 * decreases exponentially.
 *      * When adding a new address to a full bucket, a randomly chosen entry
 * (with a bias favoring less recently seen
 *        ones) is removed from it first.
 *    * Addresses of nodes that are known to be accessible go into 256 "tried"
 * buckets.
 *      * Each address range selects at random 8 of these buckets.
 *      * The actual bucket is chosen from one of these, based on the full
 * address.
 *      * When adding a new good address to a full bucket, a randomly chosen
 * entry (with a bias favoring less recently
 *        tried ones) is evicted from it, back to the "new" buckets.
 *    * Bucket selection is based on cryptographic hashing, using a
 * randomly-generated 256-bit key, which should not
 *      be observable by adversaries.
 *    * Several indexes are kept for high performance. Setting
 * m_consistency_check_ratio with the -checkaddrman configuration option will
 * introduce (expensive) consistency checks for the entire data structure.
