/**
 * Data structure that represents a partial merkle tree.
 *
 * It represents a subset of the txid's of a known block, in a way that
 * allows recovery of the list of txid's and the merkle root, in an
 * authenticated way.
 *
 * The encoding works as follows: we traverse the tree in depth-first order,
 * storing a bit for each traversed node, signifying whether the node is the
 * parent of at least one matched leaf txid (or a matched txid itself). In
 * case we are at the leaf level, or this bit is 0, its merkle node hash is
 * stored, and its children are not explored further. Otherwise, no hash is
 * stored, but we recurse into both (or the only) child branch. During
 * decoding, the same depth-first traversal is performed, consuming bits and
 * hashes as they written during encoding.
 *
 * The serialization is fixed and provides a hard guarantee about the
 * encoded size:
 *
 *   SIZE <= 10 + ceil(32.25*N)
 *
 * Where N represents the number of leaf nodes of the partial tree. N itself
 * is bounded by:
 *
 *   N <= total_transactions
 *   N <= 1 + matched_transactions*tree_height
 *
 * The serialization format:
 *  - uint32     total_transactions (4 bytes)
 *  - varint     number of hashes   (1-3 bytes)
 *  - uint256[]  hashes in depth-first order (<= 32*N bytes)
 *  - varint     number of bytes of flag bits (1-3 bytes)
 *  - byte[]     flag bits, packed per 8 in a byte, least significant bit first
 * (<= 2*N-1 bits)
 * The size constraints follow from this.
