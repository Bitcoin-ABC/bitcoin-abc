/*
 * Has similar API semantics, but produces Merkle roots and validates
 * branches 3x as fast, and without the mutation vulnerability. Cannot
 * be substituted for the non-fast variants because the hash values are
 * different. ComputeFastMerkleBranch returns a pair with the second
 * element being the path used to validate the branch.
 *
 * Because the fast Merkle branch does not do unnecessary hash operations,
 * the path used to validate a branch is derived from but not necessarily
 * the same as the original position in the list. ComputeFastMerkleBranch
 * calculates the path by dropping high-order zeros from the binary
 * representation of the position until the path is the same length or
 * less as the number of Merkle branches.
 *
 * To understand why this works, consider a list of 303 elements from
 * which a fast Merkle tree is constructed, and we request the branch to
 * the 292nd element. The binary encoded positions of the last and
 * desired elements are as follows:
 *
 *   0b 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 # decimal 302 (zero-indexed)
 *
 *   0b 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 # decimal 291
 *
 * The root of the Merkle tree has a left branch that contains 2^8 = 256
 * elements, and a right branch that contains the remaining 47. The first
 * level of the right branch contains 2^5 = 32 nodes on the left side, and
 * the remaining 15 nodes on the right side. The next level contains 2^3 =
 * 8 nodes on the left, and the remaining 7 on the right. This pattern
 * repeats on the right hand side of the tree: each layer has the largest
 * remaining power of two on the left, and the residual on the right.
 *
 * Notice specifically that the sizes of the sub-trees correspnd to the
 * set bits in the zero-based index of the final element. For each 1 at,
 * index n, there is a branch with 2^n elements on the left and the
 * remaining amount on the right.
 *
 * So, for an element whose path traverse the right-side of the tree, the
 * intervening levels (e.g. 2^7 and 2^6) are missing. These correspond to
 * zeros in the binary expansion, and they are removed from the path
 * description. However once the path takes a left-turn into the tree (a
 * zero where a one is present in the expansion of the last element), the
 * sub-tree is full and no more 0's can be pruned out.
 *
 * So the path for element 292 becomes:
 *
 *     0b 1 - - 1 - 0 0 1 1 # decimal 291
 *
 *   = 0b 1 1 0 0 1 1
 *
 *   = 51
