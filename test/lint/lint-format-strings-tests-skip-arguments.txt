++++++++++ With 1 skipped argument ++++++++++

--- Good ones ---
fprintf(skipped, "%d", 1);
fprintf(skipped, "%a%s%f", 1, "anything", 3);

-- Too many arguments ---
fprintf(skipped, "%d", 1, 2); => error

--- Not enough argument ---
fprintf(skipped, "%d"); should throw => error

++++++++++ With 2 skipped arguments ++++++++++

--- Good ones ---
snprintf(skip1, skip2, "%d", 1);
snprintf(skip1, skip2, "%a%s%f", 1, "anything", 3);

-- Too many arguments ---
snprintf(skip1, skip2, "%d", 1, 2); => error

--- Not enough argument ---
snprintf(skip1, skip2, "%d"); should throw => error
snprintf(skip1, "%d"); should throw => parse error
