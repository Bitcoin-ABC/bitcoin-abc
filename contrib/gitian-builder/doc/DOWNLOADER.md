# Gitian Downloader

## Download config

Construct a download config:

    --- 
    signers:
      BF6273FAEF7CC0BA1F562E50989F6B3048A116B5:
        weight: 20
        name: Devrandom
        key: devrandom
    minimum_weight: 30

The keys can be extracted with:

  gpg --export-options export-minimal --export KEYID

and saved into devrandom-key.pgp (see "key" in signers).

The long key id can be obtained with:

  gpg --status-fd 1 --dry-run --import KEYFILE

## ZIP file

The zip file should have the payload produced in build/out by gbuild, plus a gitian directory.  The gitian directory should contain files of the form:

    devrandom-build.assert
    devrandom-build.assert.pgp

where the FILE.assert file is the PACKAGE-res.yml build report and the .pgp file is signature.pgp generated by gsign.

## Running the downloader

    gitian-updater --url file:///tmp/PACKAGE.zip  --config PACKAGE-download-config --dest DEST

Of course, the URL can be external rather than on the file system.
