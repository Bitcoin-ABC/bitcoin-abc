# chronik.e.cash

Documentation site with live methods for chronik and chronik-client.

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

# Development

The latest version of Bitcoin ABC is needed to generate appropriate download links. Docusaurus gets this information from the file `.abclatestversion`.

In order to run docusaurus locally, you will need this file in place.

`cp .abclatestversion.sample .abclatestversion`

For deployment, it should be overwritten with the latest version.
