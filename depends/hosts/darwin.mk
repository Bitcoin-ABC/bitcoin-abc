#
#         Adds path_a, path_b, and path_c to the bottom of clang's list of
#         include search paths. This is used to explicitly specify the list of
#         system include search paths and its ordering, rather than rely on
#         clang's autodetection routine. This routine has been shown to:
#             1. Fail to pickup libc++ headers in $SYSROOT/usr/include/c++/v1
#                when clang was built manually (see: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/17919#issuecomment-656785034)
#             2. Fail to pickup C headers in $SYSROOT/usr/include when
#                C_INCLUDE_DIRS was specified at configure time (see: https://gist.github.com/dongcarl/5cdc6990b7599e8a5bf6d2a9c70e82f9)
#
#         Talking directly to cc1 with -Xclang here grants us access to specify
#         more granular categories for these system include search paths, and we
#         can use the correct categories that these search paths would have been
#         placed in if the autodetection routine had worked correctly. (see:
#         https://gist.github.com/dongcarl/5cdc6990b7599e8a5bf6d2a9c70e82f9#the-treatment)
#
#         Furthermore, it places these search paths after any "non-Xclang"
#         specified search paths. This prevents any additional clang options or
#         environment variables from coming after or in between these system
#         include search paths, as that would be wrong in general but would also
#         break #include_next's.
