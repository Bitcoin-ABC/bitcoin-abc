# Prints to stdout a SHA256 hash representing the current toolset, used by
# depends/Makefile as a build id for caching purposes (detecting when the
# toolset has changed and the cache needs to be invalidated).
#
# If the DEBUG environment variable is non-empty and the system has `tee`
# available in its $PATH, the pre-image to the SHA256 hash will be printed to
# stderr. This is to help developers debug caching issues in depends.

# This script explicitly does not `set -e` because id determination is mostly
# opportunistic: it is fine that things fail, as long as they fail consistently.

# Command variables (CC/CXX/AR) which can be blank are invoked with `bash -c`,
# because the "command not found" error message printed by shells often include
# the line number, like so:
#
#     ./depends/gen_id: line 43: --version: command not found
#
# By invoking with `bash -c`, we ensure that the line number is always 1
