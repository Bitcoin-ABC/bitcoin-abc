    Disable threading to fix non-determinism

    A bug in the file parser can cause dependencies to be calculated
    differently based on which files have already been parsed. This is more
    likely to occur on systems with more CPUs.

    Just disable threading for now. There is no noticable slowdown.

    See #9891.
