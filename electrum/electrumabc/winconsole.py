    Workaround to the fact that cmd.exe based execution of this program means
    it has no stdout handles and thus is always silent, thereby rendering
    vernbose console output or command-line usage problematic.

    First, check if we have STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE (a console) and do nothing if
    there is one, returning True.

    Otherwise, try to attach to the console of any ancestor process, and return
    True.

    If not successful, optionally (create=True) create a new console.

    NB: Creating a new console results in a 'cmd.exe' console window to be
    created on the Windows desktop, so only pass create=True if that's
    acceptable.

    If a console was found or created, we redirect current output handles
    (sys.stdout, sys.stderr) to this found and/or created console.

    Always return True on success or if there was a console already,
    False on failure.
