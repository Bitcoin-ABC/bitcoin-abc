# Release notes

## Release 5.2.8

- Fix a bug affecting the expected number of signatures by multisig wallets:
  a change in the previous release caused the wallet to expect N signatures
  instead of M signatures for a M-of-N multisig (D14483).
- Fix a bug when running from source if gmpy is installed and causes the
  ecdsa library to use gmpy.mpz objects instead of python integers for curve
  points (D14490).
- Make the coin consolidation tool use Schnorr signatures (D14491) and
  speed-up the process by avoiding unnecessary serializations for estimating
  the size of transactions (D14492).
- Slightly improve the performance of some serialization operations and reduce
  the memory footprint of transactions, keys and block headers, by using
  bytes rather than hex strings (D14503, D14509, D14472, D14524, D14567,
  D14568, D14569, D14570).
- Improve UX when using open-aliases in the Pay To form, support the oa1:xec
  prefix, drop support for the oa1:bch prefix (D14532, D14550).
- Minor improvements to UX in the Proof Editor (D14602).
- Stop incentivizing private key reuse for Avalanche Proofs and
  Avalanche Delegations (D14603).


## Release 5.2.7

- Fix a bug in the command line argument processing preventing the application
  from recognizing BIP 21 payment URLs when passed as the only argument. This
  fixes the `ecash:` MIME type association with Electrum ABC (D14382).
- Speed up the size estimation for freshly generated transactions by removing
  the need to serialize them first (D14434, D14448).
- Slightly improve the performance of some serialization operations by reducing
  the number of unnecessary bytes-to-hex conversions (D14455, D14462, D14463, D14464).
- Support Python 3.12 (D14440).


## Release 5.2.6

- Increase the maximum number of concurrent get_merkle network requests to speed
  up the initial verification of the transaction history for wallets with a
  large history (D14123).
- Write unencrypted wallet files using compact JSON. This reduces the file size
  by about 20% and increases the speed of the operation by about 100% (D14234).
- Use faster compression settings when saving encrypted wallets to increase the
  speed of the operation by about 80% (D14235).
- Significantly improve the speed of building transactions in wallets with many
  coins per address. This reduces GUI freezing when interacting with the "Send"
  tab for such wallets (D14249).
- Improve the functional tests (D14273, D14274, D14276, D14278, D14293).
- Improve the developer documentation (D14142, D14259, D14285).
- Electron Cash backport:
  - Fix the QR code scanner for the Linux AppImage release (D14284)


## Release 5.2.5

- Fix a bug breaking the application when installed with the Windows installer.
- Remove option to run the application from the command line on Windows with the
  released binary when using the default Windows terminal. Users can still use the
  command line on Windows with more advanced terminal application (e.g. Git Bash)
  or by running the application from sources.
- Add a test_runner.py script.

  - Updates for build scripts.


## Release 5.0.1

- Fix the missing thousands separator when formatting amounts on Mac OS and Windows.
- Update the API for block explorers after the rebranding. Most block explorers now use the "ecash:" prefix for
  addresses. Some explorer changed their URLs.
- Fix an issue with the transaction details dialog splitting addresses and amounts over two lines when the "ecash:"
  prefix is shown in the address.
- Add CoinGecko's new eCash exchange rate for fiat amount conversion. The legacy BCHA exchange rate API is still
  supported because the new one does not provide historical data prior to July 2021.
- Add explorer.be.cash to the list of supported block explorers.
- Set explorer.bitcoinabc.org as the default block explorer.
- Electron Cash backports:
  - Increase CashFusion transaction fees for high tiers (https://github.com/Electron-Cash/Electron-Cash/pull/1984)


## Release 5.0.0

- Rebranding from BCHA to eCash (XEC).
- Change base unit from BCHA (100 000 000 satoshis) to XEC (100 satoshis).
- Change CashAddr prefix from "bitcoincash:" to "ecash:".

  BCH address and Legacy Bitcoin address.
- Interpret amounts as XEC in BIP21 payment URIs. Generate payment URIs and
  QR codes with amounts in XEC.
- Add a scanner for usual eCash, BCH or BTC derivation paths to assist users
  when restoring a wallet from seed (feature backported from Electron Cash).


## Release 4.3.3

- Support restoring wallets from BIP39 word lists in other languages than
  english. New seeds phrases are still generated in english, because most
  other wallets only support english.
- Use the new derivation path `m/44'/899'/0` by default when creating or
  restoring a wallet. This is a pre-filled parameter that can be modified
  by the user. The BCH and BTC derivations paths are shown in a help
  message for users who wish to restore pre-fork wallets.
- Prefer sending confirmed coins when sending a transaction. Unconfirmed coins
  can still be used when necessary or when they are manually selected.
- Display a warning when sending funds to a legacy BTC address.
- Update some default configuration parameters the first time the user runs
  a new version of Electrum ABC (default fee, default CashFusion server).
- Display localized amounts with thousands separators to improve readability
  when switching the unit to mBCHA or bits.
- Always show the prefix when displaying a CashAddr in the user interface.
  This will prevent confusion when the prefix is changed, in the future.
- Support arbitrary CashAddr prefixes for the address conversion tool.
- Improvements to the Satochip plugin:
  - use BIP39 seeds by default instead of electrum seeds.
  - 2FA config is removed from initial setup, and can be activated from the
    option menu instead (clicking on the Satochip logo on the lower right
    corner).
  - PIN can have a maximum length of 16, not 64.
- Add a menu action in the Coins tab to export data for selected UTXOs to a
  JSON file.
- Use satoshis as a unit for amounts when generating payment URIs and QR codes.
  This aligns Electrum ABC with CashTab, Stamp and Cashew.
- Lower the default transaction fee from 10 satoshis/byte to 5 satoshis/byte.
- Minor performance improvements when freezing coins and saving wallet files.


## Release 4.3.2

- Decrease the default transaction fee from 80 satoshis/byte to 10 sats/byte
- Add an option in the 'Pay to' context menu to scan the current screen
  for a QR code.
- Add a documentation page "Contributing to Electrum ABC".
- Remove the deprecated CashShuffle plugin.
- Specify a default server for CashFusion.
- Fix a bug introduced in 4.3.1 when starting the program from the source
  package when the `secp256k1` library is not available. This bug did not
  affect the released binary files.
- Fix a bug related to the initial automatic copy of wallets from the
  Electron Cash data directory on Windows. The configuration paths were not
  changed accordingly, causing new wallets to be automatically saved in the
  Electron Cash directory.


## Release 4.3.1

- Fixed a bug happening when clicking on a server in the network overview
  dialog.
- Enable the fiat display again, using CoinGecko's price for BCHA.
- Add a checkpoint to ensure only BCHA servers can be used. When splitting
  coins, it is now recommended to run both Electrum ABC and Electron Cash.
- Improve the automatic importing of wallets and user settings from
  Electron Cash, for new users: clear fiat historic exchange rates to avoid
  displaying BCH prices for pre-fork transactions, clear the server blacklist
  and whitelist, copy also testnet wallets and settings.
- When creating a new wallet, always save the file in the standard user
  directory. Previously, wallets were saved in the same directory as the
  most recently opened wallet.
- Change the crash report window to redirect users to github in their
  web browser, with a pre-filled issue ready to be submitted.
- Fix a bug when attempting to interact with a Trezor T hardware wallet
  with the autolock feature enabled, when the device is locked.


## Release 4.3.0

 The first release is based on the
Electron Cash 4.2.0 codebase with the following changes

- updated list of electrum servers
- updated icons and branding
- use different directory for wallets and configuration
- automatically import wallets and some configuration files from Electron Cash
