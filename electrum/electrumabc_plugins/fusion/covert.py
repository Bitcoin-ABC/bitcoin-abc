Covert submission mechanism

- Open numerous connections at random times.
- Send data (component) at random times on random connections.
- Send more data (signature) at a later random time, but on the same connection.
- Close the connections at random times.
- Keep some spare connections in case of problems.

Each connection gets its own thread.
