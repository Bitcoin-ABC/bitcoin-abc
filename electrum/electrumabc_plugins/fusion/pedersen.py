Pedersen commitments on secp256k1 --

    commitment = nonce*G + amount*H

where G is the regular base point and H is a secondary base point with an
unknown discrete logarithm with respect to G. One should choose H as a
"nothing-up-my-sleeve" point with an obviously chosen x coordinate.

nonce and amount are scalars. The nonce should be randomly and uniformly
selected for each commitment, and the amount committed is a modular number.

Note that commitments to negative amounts are indistinguishable from
commitments to very large amounts. In practice, you probably need some kind
of additional mechanism (commitment reveal, range proof) to make sure the
amount is sensible.
